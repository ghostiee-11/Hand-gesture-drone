Hand Gesture Recognition for Drone Control 🚀
This project implements hand gesture recognition using computer vision and deep learning to control a drone. It utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV for real-time hand tracking, extracts hand landmarks, and maps them to predefined gestures. The collected gesture data can be used to train a machine learning model for robust classification and future drone integration.

📌 Features
✔️ Real-time Hand Tracking using MediaPipe
✔️ Landmark Extraction for precise gesture recognition
✔️ Gesture Data Collection stored in CSV format
✔️ Predefined Gestures: up, down, flip, stop, throttle
✔️ Scalability: Extendable for more gestures and ML-based classification

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
OpenCV – Computer vision for real-time video processing
MediaPipe – Hand tracking and landmark extraction
NumPy & Pandas – Data processing and storage
Matplotlib (optional) – For data visualization

🖐️ Gesture Collection Process
The camera captures real-time video.
MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.
Gestures are labeled (up, down, etc.).
The extracted data is stored in CSV format.
This data can be used for training an ML model.
📈 Future Enhancements
🚀 Machine Learning Model: Train a classifier for gesture prediction
🚀 Integration with Drones: Implement communication with drone APIs
🚀 Voice Commands: Combine gesture & voice for hybrid control
🚀 Web Interface: Remote control via Flask or React
